# Observability
> **Formal Definition**: Observability is a strategy that exposes service variables to enable monitoring of a service.
<br/>

In practice, observability is usually a two-step process. The first step is the collection of service variables, and the second step is the exportation of these service variables to a [monitoring](./monitoring.md) platform.
