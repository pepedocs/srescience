# Service
SRE practices can be reduced to their core subject - the abstract version of a software service.

To precisely and consistently express an abstract service or simply a service, its parts, and its derivatives, a service must first be defined.
<br/><br/>

> **Formal Definition**: A service (S) is a set of [service states](./service-state.md).
>
>  - `S = { s | s is an element of ST }`
>
>  - `ST = Set of service states`
