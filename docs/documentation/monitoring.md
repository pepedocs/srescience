# Monitoring
> **Formal Definition**: Monitoring is an automation strategy for inferring and presenting service states given a collection of observable service variables.
<br/>

<br/>
In practice, the set of service variables is presented as metrics and is usually in a time-series data type. Inference of service states is achieved by the evaluation of a rule expressed in a specific monitoring platform query language.
