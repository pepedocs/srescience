# Conventions
Throughout this website, global conventions are used to encourage consistency in the documentation.

The following are these conventions and can be skipped for now and referenced later as needed.

### Creating axioms
**Axioms** are created as needed to support a definition.

### Writing service names
A service state name is written in *camelCase* form and is an identifier that must be descriptive to a service state such as **UploadInProgress**, **UploadError**, or **UploadFinalizing**.

### Practical service data format
Practical examples for service data such as service, service states, etc are presented in YAML format for usability and interoperability purposes.
