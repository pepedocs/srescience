# Service
SRE practices can be reduced to their core subject - the abstract version of a software service.

To precisely and consistently express an abstract service or a service, its parts, and its derivatives, a service must first be defined precisely.
<br/><br/>

> **Formal Definition**: A service *S* is a finite-state machine of the following quintuple `(ServiceStates, ServiceInputs, ServiceStart, ServiceEnd, ServiceTransitionFunction)`:
>  <br/><br/>
>  `ServiceStates` = A set of all [service states](./service-state.md) that can happen in S's lifetime.
>   <br/><br/>
>  `ServiceInputs` = A set of actions that is generated by a [service modifier](./service-modifier.md) and can be fed into a ServiceTransitionFunction.
>   <br/><br/>
>  `ServiceTransitionFunction` = A logic that takes a service state and a service input as inputs and in turn outputs a service state.
>   <br/><br/>
>  `ServiceStart` = The starting service state of S.
>   <br/><br/>
>  `ServiceEnd` = A set of service states that can happen last in S's lifetime.

<br/>

To reinforce the understanding of a service as a finite-state machine, the following is provided as a practical and intuitive example that describes the data of a naive cloud storage service.

<br/>

```
Service: Cloud Storage
    ServiceStates:
        - name: UploadRequested
          description: An upload request was initiated by a client.
        - name: Uploading
          description: The service is uploading a client's file data.
        - name: UploadFailed
          description: The service failed to upload a client's file data.
        - name: UploadFinished
          description: The service finished uploading all the client's file data.
    ServiceInputs:
        - name: UploadAPIRequest
          description: A client requested an upload through the cloud-storage upload API.
    ServiceTransitionFunction:
        - input: UploadAPIRequest
          state: UploadFailed
          output: UploadRequested
    ServiceStart: UploadRequested
    ServiceEnd:
        - UploadFinished
        - Uploading
        - UploadRequested
        - UploadFailed
```
