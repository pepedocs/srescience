# Observability
> **Formal Definition**: Observability is a strategy that exposes service variable values to enable monitoring of a service.
<br/>

It’s therefore an automation strategy with the following end goals.

- Expose service variable values
- Enable service monitoring


In practice, observability is usually a two-step process. The first step is the collection of service variables, and the second step is the exportation of these service variables to a [monitoring](./monitoring.md) platform.
