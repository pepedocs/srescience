Without these fundamental models, the meaning of SRE is difficult to untangle and will likely have varying degrees of subjective interpretations where the potential consequence of it is that SRE will likely end up as organizational culture instead of a robust discipline that can be studied theoretically, taught in universities, and most importantly advance as a computer science field.
