It is important to mention that there are great architectural patterns for improving reliability that became design conventions from a service design point-of-view, however, in practice, their effects are in a wide spectrum of cost efficiency and customer satisfaction, therefore from a business perspective, their negative effects can be either operationally costly or unnecessary. We may loosely call these effects <strong>service entropy</strong> especially if their effects are difficult to quantify from a reliability perspective.</p>`,40),n=[r];function c(o,l,p,h,d,u){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const m=e(s,[["render",c]]);export{v as __pageData,m as default};
