# Methods of Service State Consumption
There can be multiple methods of consuming service states. By "consumption" this simply means how these states are processed. For example, a state could be, but not limited to, aggregated with other states or variables, separated with other states or variables, deleted, updated, interpreted or created.

> It is important to know these methods of service state consumption because they are more fundamental than their use cases such as Obervability and Monitoring.

# Methods
The following are methods of service state consumption which can be applied to a service or multiple services.

## Collection
Collection is a method for collecting states.

## Aggregation
Aggregation is a method for aggregating states

## Inference
Inference is a method for inferring sets of variables to a state.

## Interpretation
Interpretation is a method for reading states.

## Relay
Relay is a method for relaying states to another consumer.
