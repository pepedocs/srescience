# Service
SRE practices can be reduced to their core subject - the abstract version of a software service. To precisely and consistently express an abstract service or simply a service, its parts, and its derivatives, a service needs to be defined first using a robust and widely accepted mathematical model.
<br/><br/>

> **Formal Definition**: A service is a specialization of a [finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) where the following are its specialized attributes.

<br/>


| FSM Attribute or Behavior          | Service Attribute or Behavior |
-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Input Alphabet (Sigma)     | This is the set of stimulus that are generated by [service modifiers](). For example, user input when logging into a service, or another service's interaction to another service through HTTP requests.
| Set of States or S           | The set of all [service states](./service-state.md) that a service can be in. For example, uploading state, rate-limiting state, shutdown state, and etc. |
| Initial State or s0          | The initial service state. This could be any known service state that happens before any other service states. |
| State Transition Function or (Delta) | The service function or logic that processes stimuli generated by service modifiers that cause a service state to transition to another service state. |

In practice, it is often enough to intuit that a service is a bounded set of service states and leave the transition details in the service state definition.
