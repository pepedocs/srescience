In order to understand this status quo, these two concepts need to be dissected using the methods of consumption.</p><p>Today (3/21/2024), Observability and Monitoring are almost indistinguishable with each other, organizations use these two terms interchangeably. To make the long story short, Observability means almost everything including monitoring. The distinction of monitoring is that it&#39;s the process of <code>monitoring</code> metrics and <code>alerting</code>.</p><p>The process of monitoring and alerting can be naively classified into the <code>Tracking</code> and <code>Relay</code> methods of consumption, respectively. However, the key indicator of the status quo of Observability and Monitoring is that there is no clear separation of concerns with regards to which of them does each of the consumption methods.</p><h2 id="emerging-observability-and-monitoring" tabindex="-1">Emerging Observability and Monitoring <a class="header-anchor" href="#emerging-observability-and-monitoring" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>There is an emerging understanding in Observability and Monitoring concepts. It&#39;s stark difference from the status quo is that it separates the concerns of the consumption methods. This separation is evident in <code>https://www.honeycomb.io/</code>&#39;s strong stance in Observability. The separation of these methods of consumption is clear and while at the time of this writing, there isn&#39;t enough research done about it, it can be safely inferred that the separation is that <code>Tracking</code> and <code>Relay</code> are Monitoring&#39;s concern. However, there is more emphasis on Observability and this can mean that Monitoring will not necessarily evolve its tracking and relaying methods.</p><h2 id="consequences" tabindex="-1">Consequences <a class="header-anchor" href="#consequences" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The consequences of these methods of consumption with respect to srescience is that it obsoletes the current (3/21/2024) definition of Monitoring and Observability in favor of the emphasis of these consumption methods.</p>',27),r=[a];function s(c,h,d,l,g,m){return i(),t("div",null,r)}const f=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
