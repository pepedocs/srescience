# Rationale
The continuing success of SRE implementations in diverse organizations is not to be underestimated. However, these implementations do not necessarily enable the SRE community to study and define the SRE practice in a theoretical manner, and this is because these implementations are largely based on hard-earned experiences therefore they do not guarantee convergence of ideas and essentially do not solidify into fundamental models that can be consistently utilized to express any aspect of SRE in an organizational or experience-agnostic manner. Without these fundamental models, the meaning of SRE is difficult to untangle and will likely have varying degrees of subjective interpretations where the potential consequence of it is that SRE will likely end up as organizational culture instead of a robust discipline that can be studied theoretically, taught in universities, and most importantly advance as a computer science field.
