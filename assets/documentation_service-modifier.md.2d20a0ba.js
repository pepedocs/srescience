This is so that a definition of a user is clear cut about it being able to modify a service state. By doing this, it effectively includes a &quot;user&quot; in the semantics of a service as a finite-state machine. <br><br></p><blockquote><p><em>Speaking and listening was never a chicken-and-egg situation, the latter must go first to fill the brain.</em>\u200A-\u200AAnonymous</p></blockquote>',7),o=[r];function n(c,d,l,v,u,f){return i(),t("div",null,o)}const p=e(a,[["render",n]]);export{g as __pageData,p as default};
